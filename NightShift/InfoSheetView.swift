Neville Goddard taught that your imagination creates reality. His evening technique involves relaxing the body, entering a sleepy state, and imagining a scene that implies your desire is already fulfilled.

 Practice it every night until it feels real â€” every part of it.
 Fall asleep in the feeling of the wish fulfilled to impress the subconscious mind.

Repeat this nightly to impress the subconscious mind.

**Core Principles:**
â€¢ Imagination is reality
â€¢ Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled
â€¢ Feeling is the secret

**Recommended Books:**
â€¢ Feeling is the Secret
â€¢ The Power of Awareness
â€¢ Your Faith is Your Fortune
â€¢ Awakened Imagination
â€¢ Out of This World

You donâ€™t force the dream â€” you *live in it* as if itâ€™s already true.
